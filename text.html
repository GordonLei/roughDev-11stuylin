            <h1> The Tragedy of Darth Plagueis</h1>
                Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? <br>
                I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. <br>
                It’s a Sith legend. <br>
                Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… <br>
                He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. <br>
                The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. <br>
                He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. <br>
                Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. <br>
                Ironic. <br>
                He could save others from death, but not himself.<br>

            <h1> How to get into Harvard </h1>
            <br><br><br><br>
            Many people always ask me how I was able to get into Harvard as a 16 year old who skipped 3 grades of high school. <br>
            They think I got in because of my scholarly records, but no the key is the interview.<br>
            As I sat in the Harvard Dean's office in front of the board of reviewers for my application, the Dean asks me "Why should you be a good candidate for this school?" <br>
            They seemed bored but I replied "Well I was born a child prodigy, <br>
            placed 1st in my state spelling bee for three consecutive years, <br>
            I can speak eight different languages not counting Latin, <br>
            play four different instruments, <br>
            I skipped grades 4 through 6, <br>
            and graduated my high school as valedictorian at the age of 14. <br>
            I then worked as an intern at both Telsa, and NASA." <br>
            Suddenly the room burst into laughter and many of board instantly started scribbling down "No" near the application check marks. <br>
            The Dean says "Sorry but you are just not the type we are looking for." <br>
            But then I said "Excuse me but I wasn't finished... I watch Rick and Morty" <br>
            The Dean looked at me like an idiot and said "So....?" <br>
            Then I replied with a smile "And I understand all the references and subtle jokes" <br>
            An audible gasp let out by the board was so loud the secretary had to come in. <br>
            You could hear a pin drop and then suddenly all at once the entire board clicked their pens on the "Approved Box" and I was instantly handed a diploma and now I'm teaching advanced physicals there. <br>
            I guess you can say I'm pretty smart. :) <br>
